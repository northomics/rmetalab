The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is defined as follows:

$$latex
f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} 
e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }
$$

To generate random draws from a normal distribution we use the **rnorm** function:

```{r block1}

output <- rnorm(1000, 50, 15)

```

The normal distribution has the typical bell shape:

```{r block2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(output)
```

## Kernel density estimation

We can perform density estimation on the sample:

```{r block3, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
plot(density(output))
```
